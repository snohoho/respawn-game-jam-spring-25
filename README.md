##Description
Dave has quickly risen to the top of every streaming platform. The only problem? He can never have a peaceful broadcast, always getting messaged and hacked. Counter-hack, reply to messages, chat and donations, and game your way to the best stream ever. It only gets harder as time goes on, but keep calm!

Successful counter-hacks will decrease ads for a while, but failing will instead make them more frequent. Doing things right will increase viewership, while doing bad in the game or picking wrong options will lose viewers. Reach zero and the stream's over!

Made within 72 hours for Respawn Game Jam Spring 2025 at Florida Polytechnic University.
